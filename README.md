#### Benoît GANIVET, participant to the SUN TRIP RACES 2019 & 2020, needed a website to present his project and find fundings. We created this website for him, with a CMS admin section so he can easily maintain his website in the future.

#### This project was the 3rd and last team project of our coding training at WILD CODE SCHOOL.
