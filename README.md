## NORMANDY SUN BIKE  V.1.0, january 2019    http://normandysunbike.fr

### Created by H. Agnès GENAY, Gaëtan HARDY, Etienne RABIN

#### Benoît GANIVET, participant to the SUN TRIP RACES 2019 & 2020, needed a website to present his project and find fundings. We created this website for him, with a CMS admin section so he can easily maintain his website in the future.

#### This project was the 3rd and last team project of our coding training at WILD CODE SCHOOL.
